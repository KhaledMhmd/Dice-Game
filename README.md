# Dice-Game
This dice game that i just made is my own rendition/interpretation of a project idea in my javascript course and an already existing game called "Pig Game". 
What I did was that I opened the existing game, saw the styles and tried to capture the same styles in my webpage (to improve my css skills) and then I wrote a javascript
code that will help the page achieve its dynamic functionality.
About the game:
There are two players taking turn in rolling the dice, the number of the dice gets added to your score unless the dice number is one then all your score is erased and the other player gets his turn. If you've got a score that you're happy with, you press "hold" and that score gets added to your total score and the other player gets his turn.
The player who gets 100 score wins.
